Winding down DBC campus operations has been a heartbreaking decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Since launching in 2012, we‰Ûªve been striving to find a viable business model that would enable us to further our vision of high-quality, immersive coding training that is broadly accessible to a diverse population, while also covering the critical day-to-day costs of running our campuses. Ultimately, we have been unable to find a sustainable model that doesn‰Ûªt compromise on one of those fronts.</p><p>While we‰Ûªre extremely disappointed we couldn‰Ûªt make this work, we‰Ûªre also celebrating the work we have done over the last five years. We want to remember and appreciate the lives we've touched and the influence we‰Ûªve had: igniting the bootcamp industry, leaving a lasting legacy of more than 3,000 skilled developers, advocating for greater diversity and inclusion in tech for underrepresented populations, heightening awareness of truth in advertising among bootcamps, creating greater focus on apprenticeships as a model for meeting employer needs, and highlighting the value of soft skills training.&nbsp;</p><p>With our employees, alumni, and partners, we shaped an industry and helped create a movement. We are grateful to our awesome DBC team for their hard work, passion, and commitment to students, and thankful for the enduring impact our alumni community continues to make on the larger tech industry.</p><p>We will maintain this meetup group until our final cohort graduates.

We grasped technology from a young age, whether mechanical or digital, developing a fascination with chips that doubled in power every two years, amazed by the computers powering the moon landing that were weaker than the phones in our hands, and infatuated with the ever evolving role technology has had in almost every facet of our lives. We watched, used, and even built the Internet from its humble beginnings into the world wide juggernaut that it is today. Today we write apps, sell software, and run companies.</span></p><p>We ride. We found the roar of an engine and the wind in our faces was something that gave us a feeling never felt before. From the first twist of a throttle we were hooked. The feeling of leaning into a corner and owning every inch of the road made us only want more. The endless customizations, unique looks, and respect for individual tastes drew us in further to the culture. We have all at some point during the middle of a ride, been overcome with a sense of true freedom that we had never felt before. &nbsp;We ride because we can‰Ûªt imagine life without it.</p><p>We find that the marriage of motorcycles and technology presents an opportunity for those that share these two core interests to come to together and feel a common bond that few others have. There is an enigma about those both intelligent enough to work in tech and wild enough to straddle an engine that when gathered together makes for an inspiring and exciting group of people. &nbsp;It presents an opportunity for those working in any facet of technology to expand their network beyond just co workers and industry peers. &nbsp;It becomes a way to start a ride with a group of strangers and have it end with new friends. &nbsp;</p><p>We are not a motorcycle club; but we respect their heritage and histories.</p><p>We are not pretending to be ‰Û÷bikers‰Ûª; but we are far more than just ‰Û÷weekend warriors‰Ûª.</p><p>We do not wear cuts, colors, rockers, nor claim any territory; the internet is our home.</p><p><span>We do not discriminate against operating systems, motorcycle brands, races, religions, political affiliations, military status, sexual orientations, or gender.

Usually we will discuss things that range from ""hacking"" to urban exploration, phreaking, lock picking, programming, discoveries, social engineering, and doing what hackers do best, drinking ;) After the meetings the organizer will probably go war driving (yes we still do that, RFID is /frighteningly/ big these days), dumpster diving or finding somewhere to do some urban exploration. Austin has a pretty large tech base, and no doubt some of you were interested in 2600 at one point in time.

We're a beginner friendly group where you can work on your own projects or engage in a friendly competition called, surprisingly enough, the Project Euler Sprint!</p><p><span>The Project Euler Sprint is a friendly competition involving solving Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) problems for points. Project Euler is a series of increasingly difficult computational math problems that must be solved with code (generally speaking: we've had an impressive paper solution as well as Excel spreadsheet solutions. Color me impressed). Each problem is harder than the last, so each problem is worth its problem number in points. Problem #1 is easy, so it's worth 1 point, while problem #50 is much harder, but worth 50 points. You can form teams of 4 people and solutions can be in any language as long as it's coded there. For more detailed rules, you can check each event.</span></p><p><span>It's a low-pressure environment (I rarely get past problem #1, myself) to have fun and meet other people interested in programming.

Well, what started as three guys at a bar in Ferndale has blossomed to over 6,000 members.</p><p>In 2007, the group started a wildly popular blog series called ‰ÛÏDon‰Ûªt Be That Guy‰Û, figuring publishing the ‰ÛÏdon‰Ûªts‰Û of business networking would make the group that much more stronger. In 2011, IT in the D&nbsp;was awarded viewer‰Ûªs choice ‰ÛÏMost Valuable Blogger‰Û from CBS under the ‰Û÷Local Affairs‰Ûª category.</p><p>In 2009, during the down economy,&nbsp;<a href=""http://detroitnet.org/"">I</a>T in the D recognized that traditional Job Fairs were not the getting the job done. The group expanded to offer the ‰ÛÏPink Slip Party‰Û concept, where the only attendees could be people looking to hire IT professionals, and IT professionals looking for work. As a result of these Pink Slip Parties, and the monthly casual networking meet ups, roughly 2,000 people have found jobs. This is a testament of the laid back nature and the removal of the ‰ÛÏcattle call‰Û atmosphere typically found at job fairs.</p><p>In 2013, responding to the call of ‰ÛÏThere really isn‰Ûªt a good local tech podcast‰Û, the ‰ÛÏIT in the D Show‰Û hit the Internet. The show, recorded and broadcast live via&nbsp;<a href=""http://rawradiox.com/"">RawRadioX.com</a>, has in studio guests from local IT staffing companies, business owners and C-level executives.

Urban computing aims to enhance both human life and urban environment smartly through a recurrent process of sensing, mining, understanding, and improving. Urban computing also aims to deeply understand the nature and sciences behind the phenomenon occurring in urban spaces, using a variety of heterogeneous data sources, such as traffic flows, human mobility, geographic and map data, environment, energy consumption, populations, and economics, etc. Recently, real-world data reflecting city dynamics becomes widely available, including, e.g., users‰Ûª mobile phone signal, GPS traces of vehicles and people, ticketing data in public transportation systems, user-generated content (like tweets, micro-blog, check-ins, photos), data from transportation sensor networks (camera and loop sensors) and environment sensor networks (temperature and air quality), as well as data from the Internet of Things. As a result, we are ready to carry out real urban computing activities that lead to better and smarter cities. By better sensing and understanding the city dynamics we are more likely to design effective strategies and intelligent systems for improving urban lives.<br><br>Why is this important ?

Welcome to Consciousness Hacking Philly!</p><p>‰Û¢&nbsp;This group is all about ways to optimize and experience in the greatest way possible your own experience. What does that mean? That means that we are an idea space.</p><p>‰Û¢&nbsp;<span>We are an idea space where discussions conceive, exchange, compare, contrast and explore different ways of changing how we feel, think and live both as individuals and together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‰Û¢&nbsp;</span><span>What do we love? Science! We are huge appreciators, enthusiasts and even professionals in the sciences, be it neuroscience, transpersonal psychology, bio-hacking, chronobiology and what-have-you.</span></p><p>‰Û¢&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;We love DIY experimentations, the act of mixing different ideas and practices together be they meditation and mindfulness, meditation and mindfulness through strenuous exercise, or sustained endurance exercise; all the way to holotropic breathwork, to Wim the Iceman Hoff's cold defiance techniques.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‰Û¢&nbsp;We also love technologies - the possibilities therein. On one level, technology as a given fact of life and how to best integrate with this -- not only today but in 100 years. Furthermore, technology used explicitly as a tool for wisdom, cutting edge technologies like biofeedback and neurofeedback. Smartphone apps that aid in Jhana practice, or even just a quick meditation on your commute to work. From thereon out, technologies encapsulated in molecules. And then technologies as a barometer of our times and our collective consciousness.&nbsp;</span></p><p>‰Û¢&nbsp;<span>First and foremost, we are interested in one thing: how can we hack this consciousness? For desires and goals from leading a more harmonious, effective and productive life to all the way inwards at the most fulfilling apperception of our existence, that is our question: How can we hack this consciousness?</span></p>",1.47564E+12,Philadelphia,US,USA,"Philadelphia, PA",PA,open,public,39.95,-75.16,157,CoHackers,US/Eastern,199913815,Joe Patitucci,"Multimedia healing artist working to foster connection to intuitive states and the natural world.joepatitucci.net",254402231,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/7/highres_254402231.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/7/member_254402231.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/8/b/7/thumb_254402231.jpeg,member,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,454800550,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/6/highres_454800550.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/6/600_454800550.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/6/thumb_454800550.jpeg,event,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,454963966,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/b/e/highres_454963966.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/b/e/600_454963966.jpeg,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/b/e/thumb_454963966.jpeg,event,https://secure.meetupstatic.com,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,Tech,tech,Tech,https://api.meetup.com/Consciousness-Hacking-Philly/events

Meetings will take the form of a presentation, or an occasional expert round-table. Presentations will vary in duration, from one hour down to ten-minute ""lightning talks."" Informal interaction between presenter(s) and audience will be encouraged.</p><p>Members may submit any topic related to any AWS product or service for presentation to the group moderator. The GPAWSUG is intended to be a collaborative community of AWS end-users sharing knowledge and real-world experience. Developers, Operations, and DevOps professionals will be most at home here, but executives will be welcome and find some benefit here. The organizers will schedule presentations of interest to both AWS novices and experts. Presentations both critical of, and favorable to, AWS products are welcome.</p><p>The GPAWSUG is not intended for use as a marketing or recruiting channel. Vendors of closed-source products may discuss the technical or business problems their products solve, but product demos are not permitted. &nbsp;Because AWS is itself a commercial Amazon platform, we will occasionally invite AWS experts employed by Amazon to deliver detailed presentations about AWS products. Barring exceptional circumstances, Amazon-delivered presentations will account for no more than one out of every five presentations. Developers of open-source AWS-related products will be welcome to present those products, and demo away.</p><p>The moderator will solicit corporate or individual sponsors for every meeting, to cover venue and food costs. Sponsors will be given a five minute time slot at the beginning of every meeting to describe themselves and the products and services they offer. In appreciation for their sponsorship, the rule against sales and marketing will be waived for these five minutes.</p><p>Anyone is welcome to join this meetup, but will be asked to introduce themselves, their work, and their AWS interests and experience when joining. Membership will be subject to approval by the group organizer. Members will have access both to the site message boards and mailing list.

The question remains, then, if these voices are a small part of the marginalized groups that Pynchon talked about, just mixed in with all the rest, and don't reflect the actual attitudes of the population at large. If this is the case, then we can allow them to go on propagating their ridiculous beliefs in a place where they do as little damage as possible. If anything, it's a good thing -- an indicator of our health as a progressive society. We as a society are pushing back against extremists and racists into places where they can't be seen in the light of day. But if this isn't the case, then the alternative is something much more frightening: that those in power -- those who have claimed ""truth"" -- have found a way into the equalizing space of the Internet and have begun colonizing and pushing the natives out. History repeats itself, but on a different stage.""~Dan Truong~ <br></b></p><p> <br></p><p><b> <br></b></p><p> <br></p><p><b> <br></b></p><p><b><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/b/d/0/event_435228080.jpeg""></b></p><p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/f/event_440584607.jpeg""></p><p>Our proposal:</p><p>Identify member‰Ûªs various skill sets via this short survey.</p><p>We form virtual learning pods that will teach participants the essentials of social media and digital &nbsp;content creation.</p><p>Of course‰Û_classes can be taken at your convenience.</p><p>HSM members will form creative pods to complete specific task.</p><p>We will set up corporate accounts on the leading professional platforms.

Rather than doing all processing on-board, these DIY robocars tend to transmit the data from their on-board sensors (cameras, sonar, lidar, radar, GPS or whatever else you have) via Wifi to a laptop that runs pro-grade AI and robotics software, including TensorFlow, ROS and the rest of the Udacity Self-Driving Car toolchain.&nbsp; <br> <br> <br><a href=""http://diyrobocars.com/"">Here</a>&nbsp;are resources that will help you build, hack and race these autonomous car, as well as lists of other groups and races. <br> <br>The indoors course will have two navigational aids:&nbsp; <br> <br>1) The edges of the track and lanes will be marked by blue, green and red tape.&nbsp; <br>2) There will be an indoors positioning system in place, using the ultrawideband Pozyx system, which uses a set of fixed ultrawideband beacons to provide a local coordinate system. If you want to use this, your vehicle will have to have a Pozyx ""tag"" already attached.

Meetings typically include a couple of fast-paced but deep talks and a few demos. We don't do a lot of detailed programming instruction (there are lots of other resources for that), but instead focus on getting iOS developers and entrepreneurs together with each other and with the resources we need to succeed. Got an iOS project? Come join us!</p><p>Logistical note: On a typical meetup night, we open the meetup at 6:30 to give people some time to meet and mix at the beginning while we get set up for talks to start at 7.</p><p>Recording policy: Since our earliest days, we've tried to make our meetups a place where people could speak openly and candidly about things they were learning as app developers. We also like to get the freshest topics, and to make it easier for our speakers to share with us, our meetups are generally not recorded for online playback, and we ask that attendees refrain from recording video and audio of meetups.

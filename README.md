Analyze the geographical distribution of meetup events for targeted groups

## Summary

Identify concentrations of activity for specific communities using the Meetup API. These data should assist the development of IBM's strategic focus regarding open source community involvement. Specifically, where can IBM focus community involvement in terms of high profile meetup and event attendance and sponsorship.

## Roadmap

Project Status: https://github.ibm.com/Augustina-Ragwitz/meatmap/projects/1

The analysis starts with looking at the IBM "Big Data Developers" meetups to determine where IBM already has established communities. The next phase analyzes meetup activity for communities we are interested in targeting, like the R community. Finally, we compare the results of the two groups to see what the meetup activity looks like for these communities in the cities with established IBM communities. The final deliverable is a slide deck with visual plots summarizing the results and a spreadsheet with data points of interest in more granular detail.

### Milestone 1: Meetup API Discovery via IBM Big Data Developers

Analyze activity for the IBM "Big Data Developers" meetup groups. Key data points to consider:
* What events are coming up?
* How many RSVP's for upcoming events?
* What cities are the most active?

### Milestone 2: Meetup Community Discovery via R

Analyze activity for R Meetup groups.
* What meetup groups exist for people interested in R?
* What activity is happening in different cities across the globe? Where is the most activity?

### Milestone 3: Initial Comparison of R and IBM Big Data Activity

Compare IBM Big Data Developers activity with R meetup activity:
* What cities have the highest activity for each group?
* What cities have low activity for one and high activity for the other?
* What cities have low activity for both?

### Milestone 4: Meetup Community Analysis for Other Community Targets

Phase 2 and 3 will essentially fine tune the data requirements for answering the questions in the comparison section. Once the data requirements have been established and data retrieval is in place, analysis should be performed on additional communities of interest.

### Milestone 5: Comparison of IBM Big Data Activity and Community Targets

Repeat of Phase 3 but this time applied to the additional community data retrieved in Phase 4.

### Milestone 6: Final Report

While this will be ongoing throughout, the goal of this phase is to focus on the final deliverable.
